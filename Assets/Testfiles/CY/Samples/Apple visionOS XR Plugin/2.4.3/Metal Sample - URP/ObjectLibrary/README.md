This folder (ObjectLibrary) contains a folder called `UnityCube~` that is hidden to Unity. You can find it by right-clicking on the ObjectLibrary folder and selecting `Reveal in Finder...`.

You may print the CubeTemplatePNG image to create the 3D object that is included in the UnityCube.referenceobject file one level up.  This model is used in the reference object library in this sample. The CubeTemplatePNG image is meant to be cut out, folded, and glued together to create a paper cube.

You can display UnityCube.usdz on screen with macOS QuickLook (select the file and press the space bar) to test object tracking. Note that you will need to resize and rotate the cube a little bit to convince the device that it's a real physical object.
